## Project Overview

This project is built using Vite and styled with Tailwind. The entire project has been configured to have a "6rem" padding on the horizontal axis just to ease the development process, so please try not to manipulate those.


## Getting Started

Here are the basic steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v43-tier2-team-18.git`.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

That's it! You should now be able to see the project running locally on your machine.
